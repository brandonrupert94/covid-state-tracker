                <h2>About this webpage:</h2>
                <p>Hello and Welcome! During this global pandemic and considering how it is affecting everyone's lives, I decided
                to make a webpage that can display Covid-19 statistics per state so everyone would be able to view the
                status of their state in regards to Covid. This webpage is intended to get a quick, overview of a State's overall
                Covid-19 stats. Statistics like Positive cases, an increase in cases from yesterday, deaths, and more are available 
                here at this webpage. In addition, Resource videos for Covid-19 safety and health tips are available here as well. 
                </p>
